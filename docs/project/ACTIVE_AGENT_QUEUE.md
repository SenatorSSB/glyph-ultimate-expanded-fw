# Active Agent Queue

Status label: CURRENT.

This is the only canonical executable work queue for the Glyph repository.
Roadmap entries, Planner packets, branch names, chat recommendations, and old
calibration packets do not authorize implementation. Only a complete work
order recorded here as `READY` authorizes immediate new implementation. A
complete `PREAUTHORIZED` work order may become Ready only through its already
authorized objective mechanical activation conditions.

The former G-series queue in this file is superseded. Its history remains in
Git, but it is not current candidate supply or implementation authority.

## Interpretation

- Immediate Ready runway: `0`.
- Recorded Preauthorized runway: `0`.
- Valid mechanically activatable Preauthorized runway: `0`.
- Invalidated Preauthorized work: `0`.
- Hardware-pending work: `0`.
- Effective authorized runway: `0`.
- Current liveness result: `PLANNING_REQUIRED`.
- `GLOBAL_EVIDENCE_WAIT_SUPPORTED`: no.

The zero-runway result is a candidate-supply shortfall, not permission for the
Implementation Supervisor to invent work and not evidence that the whole
project is hardware-gated. The next operation is a fresh broad Planner audit of
current live `configurator`, followed by independent Curator authorization.

## Allowed Statuses

The queue accepts these work-order states:

```text
READY
PREAUTHORIZED
IN_PROGRESS
REVIEW
HARDWARE_TEST_REQUIRED
LOCAL_ACCEPTANCE_PENDING
HARDWARE_VALIDATED
HARDWARE_FAILED
BLOCKED_EXTERNAL
DONE
INVALIDATED_PREAUTHORIZED
```

`READY` is the only immediately executable state. `PREAUTHORIZED` is recorded
authorization, not necessarily effective runway. A Preauthorized item with
unsatisfied conditions, new judgment required, invalidation, or pending
hardware evidence is not mechanically activatable and is excluded from
effective authorized runway.

Hardware-pending items require the supporting signal
`HARDWARE_TEST_REQUIRED`. `HARDWARE_FAILED` items require the supporting signal
`REPAIR_REQUIRED`; with zero effective runway they also derive the primary
`CURATION_REQUIRED` state. `HARDWARE_TEST_REQUIRED` carries no result yet;
PARTIAL/INCONCLUSIVE stays `LOCAL_ACCEPTANCE_PENDING` with exact gaps.

## Work Orders

No work orders are currently authorized.

Every future item recorded in the machine-readable `items` list must satisfy
`docs/agent_framework/WORK_ORDER_TEMPLATE.md`. Curator owns substantive
authorization and new work-order creation. The Implementation Supervisor may
update execution and publication state for the one selected item. The Hardware
Evidence Processor may update only exact identity, evidence-reference, result,
gap, and hardware lifecycle state for an already-recorded H2/H3 candidate; it
cannot create, broaden, or authorize work. Array order is canonical priority
order, highest first.
